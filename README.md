# Adaptive-Network-Traffic-Management-in-5G-6G

Problem Statement

In the context of 5G and 6G networks, the increasing demand for bandwidth and the variability of network traffic present significant challenges for network operators. These challenges include:

1. Dynamic Traffic Patterns: Traffic can vary significantly throughout the day, requiring a responsive approach to bandwidth allocation.
2. Quality of Service (QoS): Ensuring consistent performance and reliability for users, especially during peak times, is critical.
3. Resource Utilization: Efficiently utilizing available bandwidth to minimize waste while maximizing user satisfaction.
   
To address these challenges, there is a need for an adaptive network traffic management system that can intelligently allocate bandwidth based on real-time traffic conditions.

Solution

The proposed solution utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create an Adaptive Network Traffic Management System. This system:

1. Learns optimal bandwidth management strategies through interactions with the network environment.
2. Adapts to changing traffic patterns dynamically, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
3. Employs a Q-learning algorithm to optimize the allocation of network resources based on historical data and real-time observations.

Architecture

1. Environment: The environment simulates the network's bandwidth and traffic states. Each state represents a combination of current bandwidth availability and the traffic load on the network.The actions available to the agent are increasing, decreasing, or maintaining the current bandwidth allocation.

2. Agent: The agent is the core of the system, utilizing a Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for bandwidth management. It makes decisions based on the current state of the environment and selects actions according to an epsilon-greedy strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation.

3. Reward Function: The reward function provides feedback to the agent after each action. Positive rewards are given for effective bandwidth utilization, while negative rewards are assigned for inefficient allocations (e.g., too much bandwidth for low traffic or insufficient bandwidth for high traffic).

4. Training Loop: The training process consists of multiple episodes where the agent explores different actions, updates its Q-table, and learns from the rewards it receives. As training progresses, the exploration rate decreases, leading to more consistent and optimal bandwidth management.

Results

The effectiveness of the Adaptive Network Traffic Management System can be evaluated through:

1. Cumulative Reward Analysis: A plot of cumulative rewards over episodes demonstrates how the agent improves its decision-making over time. The expectation is to see a positive trend as the agent learns optimal policies.

2. Performance Metrics: Compare the system's performance before and after implementing the reinforcement learning approach, focusing on metrics like:
   
   a.Average bandwidth utilization.
   
   b.User satisfaction scores during peak traffic hours.
   
   c.The percentage of successful connections maintained without degradation in service quality.

   d. The percentage of successful connections maintained without degradation in service quality.

3. Visualizations: Graphs illustrating the learning curve, showing how the agent's total rewards increase with training, indicating improved bandwidth management strategies.
