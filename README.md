# Adaptive-Network-Traffic-Management-in-5G-6G

Problem Statement
In the context of 5G and 6G networks, the increasing demand for bandwidth and the variability of network traffic present significant challenges for network operators. These challenges include:

1. Dynamic Traffic Patterns: Traffic can vary significantly throughout the day, requiring a responsive approach to bandwidth allocation.
2. Quality of Service (QoS): Ensuring consistent performance and reliability for users, especially during peak times, is critical.
3. Resource Utilization: Efficiently utilizing available bandwidth to minimize waste while maximizing user satisfaction.
   
To address these challenges, there is a need for an adaptive network traffic management system that can intelligently allocate bandwidth based on real-time traffic conditions.

Solution
The proposed solution utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create an Adaptive Network Traffic Management System. This system:

1. Learns optimal bandwidth management strategies through interactions with the network environment.
2. Adapts to changing traffic patterns dynamically, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
3. Employs a Q-learning algorithm to optimize the allocation of network resources based on historical data and real-time observations.
